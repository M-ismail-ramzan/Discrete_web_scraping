More Details PhD (Management Sciences) Admission Process Application FormProgram OverviewThe PhD program provides high quality management education to business scholars i.e. to discover and impart culturally and globally relevant knowledge in management sciences. The program is designed to discover management scholarship which is intellectually rigorous, morally intensive, socially integrative, culturally relevant and globally acknowledged. PhD scholars will be encouraged to carry out original work through research which connects strongly with resolving local, national and global challenges of significance. PhD in Management is offered at Islamabad at Lahore Campus.The Islamabad Campus is currently offering PhD in the following areas of specialization: ManagementFinanceHuman Resource ManagementTechnology ManagementEligibilityA Master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in a relevant subject, earned from a recognized university after a minimum of 18 years of education with CGPA of at least 3.0/4.0 or equiva lent.A minimum of 60% marks and at least 50 percentile rank in the relevant NTS subject test. The NTS GAT-Subject Score should be valid at the time of admission.Selection CriteriaAdmission is based on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s performance in the following:Performance in International GMAT or an equivalent test as per HEC ruleInterview and assessment by the Doctoral Admissions Committee (FSM DAC)Submission of Research Proposal (for the purpose of evaluation)Scheme of StudyThe PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science \xe2\x80\x93 i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. \xe2\x80\x93 and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a \xe2\x80\x98weak\xe2\x80\x99 or a \xe2\x80\x98strong\xe2\x80\x99 theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student\xe2\x80\x99s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether "true" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.

Currently working as a Financial Consultant at SilkBank Islamic Branch. His message for FASTians: "I want to start by sharing the lesson I learned from what I experienced on my journey from the days as a student to where I am right now. \xe2\x80\x9cNever be dishearten or lose hope in what\'s happening at the moment. Think about what you can do to improve your future" these words might seem boring but trust me they really kept me going. Somewhere in between my university term, I started to repent my decision about studying engineering. My family was business-oriented so my interest started developing towards it. I graduated in 2020 as an Electrical Engineer and started working for a solar company as an intern but my interest and passion towards business remained and this motivated me to take the leap from engineering to business and I applied for banking positions because what better way to learn business than through banking. And Alhumdullilah I got selected and I\'m currently working for SilkBank Islamic Branch. Studying Engineering doesn\'t mean you\'re bound to work in the engineering field only. There are endless opportunities for young graduates. This thinking is what led to where I am right now and this is just a start. I urge you all to keep working hard and have faith. Look out for all the opportunities and with all the skills you can get hired in no time. " Asad Ullah Khan Batch 16 (EE) FAST NUCES, Peshawar Campus Alumni, Saifullah Khan Durrani. Currently, working in @careem as a Training and deployment coordinator. His message for FASTians: "It is our inbuilt desire to be successful and to proceed forward consistently. Consistency in work is what really is important. The mentality of competing with each other can frequently be noticed at any stage of life and it\'s important to be steadfast during this time. I started working towards my future during the graduation period by being active in societies as I was the media head of IEEE and WIE. I worked in PC Bhurban and PC Muzzafarabad\'s Engineering Department, and Heavy Electrical Complex (HEC) as an intern. This has helped me a lot in my practical life and groomed me to be more responsible and disciplined with good leadership qualities."
